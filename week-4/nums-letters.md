# Numbers and Letters


###  What does puts do?

Puts will print out on the screen the output on a new line but returns a value of nil.


###  What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a number with no decimal point. A float is a number with a decimal point.


### What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer division will always return an integer as a result and round down to the highest integer, leaving out any remainder. Floats will include the remainder after a decimal point and give a more accurate answer.

## Hours In A Year:


```ruby
	p 24 * 365
```


## Minutes In A Decade:


```ruby
	p 24 * 365 * 60 * 60 * 10
```


## Reflection

###  How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Ruby calculates just like a calculator would. The exception is that integer division will not return any remainder if there is one and Ruby simply will round down to the whole (integer) number. Floats however, will return a remainder.


###  What is the difference between integers and floats?

An integer is a whole number with no decimal point while a float is any number (integer or fractional) that contains a decimal point.


###  What is the difference between integer and float division?

Integer division will return a whole number as a quotient and ignore any fractional part of the soluction while float division will contain the fractional or decimal part of the solution.


### What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings contain text data that is held inside quotes that can also include punctuation and digits. They are used often to store data and define variables.

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variables are defined with letters and numbers but the first character must be lowercase. Local variables are used only in the function in which they are declared.

### How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

The challenge itself was pretty simple but I had a few setup issues with my VM and finding the shared directory and that took a frustratingly long time to sort out. Once I got to the  actual exercises however, it was a nice quick review!

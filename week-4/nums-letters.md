# Numbers and Letters

###  What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a number with no decimal point. A float is a number with a decimal point.


### What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer division will return an integer as a result and so will float division but the difference is that with floats, there should often be a remainder that is not returned and instead, the answer will be rounded down to the highest integer answer. Integer calculations will always return a full and accurate answer while float calculations will simply return the whole number and cut out any fractional bit since you could not use half of a movie ticket or half of a car.

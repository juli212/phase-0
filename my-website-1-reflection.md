Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Log into GitHub and click on the plus sign button in the upper right hand corner and select create new repository. Name the repository, select public, and add an MIT license. Click the create repository button. To clone the repository, go into the repository and find the box just under the bold red line that has an https link. Highlight and copy that text and then go into Git and navigate into whatever directory you want to clone the repository into using the cd command in the command line. When in the correct folder, write "git clone [paste the link url that you copied earlier]" and hit enter. The repository will be cloned to your local computer.

Describe what open source means.
Open source software is written for and by a community. It is intended to be shared and not used for commercial purposes. Anyone and everyone can view and use the software and people are encouraged to collaborate and share their ideas about other people's work.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think it is great! Open Source is a greate resource for everyone and it can encourage people to be creative but the sheer amount of information can also be overwhelming and easy to get lost in.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
The purpose of a license is to track who uses open source software and can keep tabs on what they are doing with it. Some of them restrict what you can do with software, especially financially, and would allow developers to sue in certain situations. I think licensing is important because it stops people from stealing code and taking advantage of other people's work.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
The repetition of pushing and pulling branches git really helped me feel much more comfortable with commits. It's also made the git vs GitHub more understandable.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I spoke with a couple of people who work with open source software in order to hear their opinions. They love it! Also was able to hear different explanations of licensing that made more sense to me.

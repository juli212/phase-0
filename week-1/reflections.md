# 1.1 Think About Time

I steered my research towards flow or being in 'the zone' and how you can get into that zone more easily. It was interesting to learn about hyperfocus and how it differs from flow, mostly because it has negative aspects that are not associated with flow. To me however, it sounds like there is a lot of ambiguity between the two and whoever is describing someones focus is basing their choice on whether or not the activity being focused on is worth the time and effort being consumed. Time-boxing is a way to manage time by giving an individual or group a set amount of time to work towards a goal followed by a period of reflection and possibly a break before continuing to work on either completing the same task or starting the following one. This will be most effective in phase 0 when I am struggling to complete a task. Sometimes I hit a wall and time-boxing will force me to take a break before coming back to the problem refreshed and possibly with  new strategy.Currently, I make lists of everything I need to get done and prioritize by putting the most important things at the top. Once this is done, I write out a schedule for myself to follow. At the moment this works quite well for me but I have a lot of free time to fill up with procrastination. I also know that I a better at getting things done when I have more to do so I think that as my workload increases, I become more efficient and productive. I am going to keep doing what I have been doing becauase it seems to work well for me but I am definitely interested in incorporating meditation as a part of my daily or weekly routine.

# 1.2 The Command Line

1. A shell allows us to communicate with the computer and interprets our commands. Bash is a UNIX shell.

2. I did not have enough time to complete the task all at once and being interrupted every time I had to stop forced me to repeat a number of things. The repetition of some exercises was also kind of frustrating. (So was having to retype this response as it disappeared when i tried to submit assignment).

3. At the end, I was not able to look up any of the commands using help/man and was unable to update my help.

4. I think the most important commands tell you where you are and allow you to move around until you find yourself in a familiar place where you can start over if you have made a mistake with something.

5.
-pwd: prints working directory
-ls: lists contents
-mv: moves/renames a file or directory
-cd: changes directory
-../: takes you to parent directory
-touch: creates a new file
-mkdir: makes a new directory
-less: displays a files text and allows you to page through
-rmdir: removes a directory
-rm: removes a file
-help: looks up commands to see what they do

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning

Create new Repo: Log into GitHub and click on create new tab at top right. Select New Repository. On the next screen, name it and select public access, add a MIT license. Click on Create Repository to finish. 
Fork Repo: In GitHub, find and view the Repository you would like to Fork. Click Fork button found on upper right hand side of screen and select profile of user (in this case yourself) you would like the Repo forked to. If your user name is in front of the Repo name, you have forked it correctly.
Clone Repo: Open your terminal and make sure you are in the correct directory (use pwd). In GitHub, copy the url of the Repo you want to clone and back in the terminal type in "git clone " followed by pasting in the url you previously copied from GitHub.
Forking a repository allows you to copy already existing files rather than starting from nothing. This also allows you to merge your version of a file with someone else's after you have finished making changes.
 2. I found out that I downloaded some of my programs and saved them into the wrong places. Took me a while to figure out. Also was not able to open files with sublime through the command line. I am in the process of re-setting up my virtual machine which will hopefully solve my problems. I was able to successfully create, fork, and clone Repositories!

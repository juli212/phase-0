		<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>
				Just a couple of days ago, the term “version control” meant nothing more than its most basic definition - controlling or keeping track of different versions of a document, git was just a quicker way of saying GitHub, and GitHub was a website full of terms I didn’t understand that my coding friends would name-drop when geeking out. After a full day of research and command line coding challenges, I’ve begun to understand the importance of version control in the coding world

		<h3>Storing code with GitHub</h3>
     		<p>
        	  Storing code remotely on GitHub makes the files easily accessible for you and for your collaborators while. GitHub also provides built in documentation tools and saves a history of all changes committed to the master repository. In addition to this, GitHub is a great way to build a portfolio that allows users to easily share projects they have completed which can be very helpful for gaining employment (or just showing off...).

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
html, head, title, footer, body, paragraph, h1, h3, main, header, footer. These tags make up a very basic but complete web page. I have found that html organization geneerally does not vary much. The differences come into play when content is added in various amounts and then CSS is added to change the appearance.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Browser lays everything out from top to bottom inside the body section with a footer section, if that exists. The head section is not visible (except for the title which can be seen in the browser head and its history). HTML is generally easy to interpret since it is sequential and understanding it comes mostly from an easy-to-read format.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I was impressed with being able to create snippets with Sublime and how easy it is to do. I definitely think I will create more snippets, it would be useful to make a temporary one after creating a webpage template so that you wouldn't even have to copy and past it into another file! A shortcut I like is select next match of selection because if you are writing a long list of thinigs, or adding the same thing, you can just type something once and it is added to all of them. Before I found this, I would have copied and pasted it in however many times was necesary.

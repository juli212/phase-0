<!-- Comment!  
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
    It was nice to have a vistual to work towards. I have used HTML before but did not have any visual guides or designs in the past which made it much more difficult than this. There were some times during this exercise when I really wanted to just get the CSS done as well to see how much I could change the page so I am excited to do that in the future!

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
    Since I reviewed all of the required HTML in codecademy last night, the only thing I really had to research was how to make a horizontal rule because I could not remember the tag for that. It is generally easy for me to find and understand HTML tags that I am unfamiliar with.  

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
    The only formatting we used in the HTML were to add a couple of links to specific wordss inside sentences which at this point seemed unavoidable. I did use a couple of different levels of headers and would style them further with CSS.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
    It is pretty simple and easy to understand which I like because it has so much impact on the design. What I do not like is that it is very limited by itself. Without CSS, styling is incredibly tedious and limited but I also know that it is very easy to add CSS.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
    I am pretty familiar with HTML so I do not need much in the way of tricks. If i cannot rmember something or already know how to do it, a simple google almost always clears up my confusion and takes just a few seconds. One thing I have noticed is that formatting can make a huge difference. If the format is clear and easy to follow, writing HTML is much simpler. It is valuable to keep HTML uncluttered, both for yourself and people you are working with.

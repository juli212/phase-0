# Wireframe Reflection


What is a wireframe?


A wireframe is a blueprint of sorts that shows a detailed design of what a web page will look at. They can be very basic sketches with simple descriptions of what will go in various containers or very detailed with specifics including the colors of every element as well as the actual content that will be on the page.


What are the benefits of wireframing?


Did you enjoy wireframing your site?


Yes, it was a lot of fun. I was a little bit confused about where my wirreframing pictures were going to be displayed at first but figured it out. I am also still unclear about what exactly is going into the blog which made it hard to design the home page-I can understand why having information about the content is important for helping with the design because I would have liked to add a couple of thingss to the blog but I am not sure what will end up being appropriate and go well with the future content.


Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?


I made some slight revisions when transferring my sketch to my digital image but it mostly stayed the same. One of the things I changed was what content to put on my homepage: I had a couple of ideas but later decided I wanted to put these things in a different page. I made a note of them to myself so I will not forget.


What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?


It took me a while to find a wireframe software that was free and that I liked. I ended up using Moqups but Could not save the file without joining as a paying customer so I redrew a similar version of my wireframe on Paint++. I also keep thinking that something is missing from both wireframes but that may just be because the pages we are designing at the moment are very simple. I keep wanting to add extra things but I think that is excessive and will just end up cluttering the page and complicating the project in the future.

I found various articles describing different wireframee programs but at the moment, I need a very basic layout and design so I decided to skip having to learn how to use a complicated program for now (time constraints) though I woulld definitely like to use one in the future.


Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?


I enjoyed designing my website and blog, it was fun to do something visual. It was tediuos to transfer my sketch to an imaage on the computer. Next time I will either do a neater sketch or design straight on the computer, if I am designing such simple pagse. If they become more complex, I will probably sketch on paper and then make an image on the computer afterwards.

#  Design  Reflection  :)

![You should be seeing my site map...](/imgs/site-map.png "My Site Map")

What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?


The six phases are:

Information gathering: You must accumulate details about the purpose, goals, target audience, and content of the site.

Planning: Involves creating a site map (mine can be viewed above) and deciding what technologies should be involved.

Design: This is where you decide what sort of look and feel you want. Here the target audience comes into play because you want your site to appeal visually to that audience and be as user-friendly as possible for them!

development: Here the site, generally starting with a home page and followed by a shell  for the rest  of the pages, is actually created. The shell is often  a template for the remaining pages. 

Testing and delivery: Making sure the site, along with all of its forms and scripts, are totally functional. During this stage, compatibility across all major web  browsers is also tested.

Maintenance: As the technologies advance and new content is added, maintenance is  necessary to make sure the site continues to function properly, either by the owner or developer.


What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?


My site's primary goal is to introduce and eventually advertise myself to potential employers. There will be some personal information about my background and things I have done. It will also include many of my DBA projects to showcase what I am learning and track my progress as my abilities grow.


What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?


Hopefully my target audience (other than friends and family who are just curious about what I am doing) will be potential employers who will be very impressed and excited about the work I display. I hope to show my learning process and demonstrate that I am very capable by making my projects visible and easily accessable to them.


What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.


Primarily see my portfolio. I would also like them to be introduced to what sort of person I am however, and feel like they know me a little before they meet me. After visiting the site, I would obviously hope that they want to contact me because I am so  awesome. And impressive.


What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?


Design and UX are incredibly important if you want to have a successful website. Many  times, websites look really good but are kind of confusing and difficult to use. In my opinion, the simpler you can make a website, the easier it will be for people to navigate through it successfullyand thus have a more pleasant experience. This involves a large amount of planning because no matter how nice a site is to look at, it will not be liked if people struggle to find whatever they are looking for on it. Usability however, is not the entirety of UX but it is a large part. The UX itself is the user's overall feeling when using a site, not just how complicated it is to navigate through the page.


What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 


Designing a user-friendly website. It is important to have a website that looks appealing, particularly to the target audience, and is also easy to navigate through. This is very valuable because if a user of the site is struggling to find something the site, it can really turn down their mood and create negative feelings towards your company or whatever service you provide. If you have an easy-to-navigate site however, they will have an enjoyable experience and probably feel more satisfied by whatever services are being provided. The UX design can have a huge impact on the UX and ultimately a growing or shrinking customer base.


Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?


Making all of the spaces in Markdown to make my line-breaks pretty. My keyboard is also kind of broken so typing was annoying...until I got my external keyboard functioning.
